🔢 Counter App (Counter_APP)
📌 Project Name
Counter App – My First JavaScript Project

👋 Introduction

This is a simple Counter Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The main purpose of this project is to understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic JavaScript logic in a practical way.

This project helped me strengthen my frontend fundamentals and build confidence in JavaScript interactions.

⚙️ Working Details

The application displays a numeric counter with three buttons:

➕ Increment – Increases the counter value by 1

➖ Decrement – Decreases the counter value by 1

🔄 Reset – Resets the counter value back to 0

How it works:

The counter value is stored in a JavaScript variable (count)

Button clicks are handled using onclick events

The displayed value updates dynamically using DOM methods like:

document.getElementById()

textContent / innerHTML

This makes the app fully interactive without reloading the page.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure of the application

CSS3 – Styling and layout

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Logic and interactivity

🎨 UI Features

Clean and simple layout

Hover effects on buttons

Center-aligned counter display

Responsive-friendly structure (can be improved further)

✅ Conclusion

This Counter App is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates:

JavaScript basics

DOM manipulation

Event-driven programming

Separation of concerns (HTML, CSS, JS)

It is a small but important step in my journey as a Frontend / Full Stack Developer.


🚀 Way Forward (Future Improvements)

In future versions, I plan to:

Add minimum & maximum limits

Store counter value using localStorage

Improve mobile responsiveness

Add animations & transitions

Convert it into a React component
