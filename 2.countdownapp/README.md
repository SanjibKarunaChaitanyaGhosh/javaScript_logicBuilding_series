⏳ Countdown Timer App (countDownAPP)
📌 Project Name

Countdown Timer Application using JavaScript

👋 Introduction

This project is a simple Countdown Timer App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It demonstrates how to work with time-based logic, JavaScript intervals, and DOM manipulation.

The project is designed for beginners to understand how real-time updates work in JavaScript.

⚙️ Working Details
Core Functionality

The timer starts from 10 minutes

It decreases every 1 second

Time is displayed in MM:SS format

How it works:

Initial time is set in minutes and converted to seconds

setInterval() is used to update the timer every second

Minutes and seconds are calculated using:

Math.floor(time / 60)

time % 60

The UI updates dynamically without page reload

🔘 Button Features

The app includes three buttons (logic can be enhanced further):

Increase → Intended to increase timer value

Decrease → Intended to decrease timer value

Reset → Resets the timer

(Future versions will fully synchronize buttons with the countdown logic)

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Page structure

CSS3 – Styling and layout

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Countdown logic & DOM handling

🎨 UI Highlights

Centered countdown display

Bold and readable timer text

Simple color-based design

Clean layout suitable for beginners
